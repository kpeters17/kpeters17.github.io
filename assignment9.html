    <h1>Assignment 9</h1>

    <p>This activity was about using github's dev editor and the basics of HTML. I learned that HTML is composed of
        several tags and everything is either in the head section or body. Websites can be created using HTML and images added with the img tag. I learned of the numerous online
            HTML editors available which help turn text into properly formatted HTML web pages. This is very useful
            information going forward, I will now be able to create basic websites and I can use it to arrange
            information in easy to read ways such as having an index page to link several other pages all from 1
            location. By being able to write in HTML it will open the door to many possible solutions to future
            problems.
