    <h1>Assignment 4</h1>

    <p>This activity was all about the differences between email and traditional mail. It also described the different
        components of an email. I learned the most popular providers are Yahoo, Outlook, and Gmail. Many providers offer tools
        in a productivity suite such as instant messaging, address books, calendars, and online storage. A header is the first 5
        lines of an email which includes From, Date, To, Subject, CC, and BCC. My biggest takeaway from this activity was
        learning about BCC. When I worked as a manager in retail, I wrote emails often and I would forward emails separately
        when I wanted to CC them without the original recipient knowing. If I had known what BCC was then I could have saved so
        much time. </p>

        <p>The activity was about composing and sending emails. I learned how to add attachments, create a signature, and more
            details about the components that go into an email. I tested out sending an email to myself using an attachment,
            creating a signature, and replying to the sent email. There are many formatting options in gmail that I never really
            paid attention to which I will most definitely be using in the future. Many of the formatting options are similar to
            those in google docs so it’s very useful to be able to just use the same features while writing emails.
        </p>

        <p>This activity was about reading email headers in detail and how malicious sites can use spoofing to trick users into
            thinking an email is from someone else. I learned how to trace an email header by viewing using the message header tool.
            By doing this, I can find out if an email has been spoofed or not. By testing this out on my spam folder I was able to
            see how an email from “facebook support” was actually from some sketchy website. This is something I will use whenever I
            have the slightest doubt about whether an email is authentic or not. By doing this I will ensure I don’t get tricked by
            email spoofing and it gives me peace of mind that I’m emailing who I think I am.</p>
