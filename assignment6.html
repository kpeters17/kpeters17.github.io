    <h1>Assignment 6</h1>

    <p>This activity was extremely motivating and interesting to me. It was about planning my career, thinking about job
        skills, salary, networking and job searching. I learned that I need to think about my personal/financial needs and
        understand my skills when looking at potential careers. It’s important to volunteer and take internship opportunities
        because of the valuable experience and opportunities to network. It’s also a good idea to get a mentor in the field to
        help give advice and insight. I will use many lessons from this activity moving forward but the main one would be to use
        more than 1 method when searching for a job. Not only will I use job posting sites but I will also use volunteer work
        and networking to help increase my odds of finding a good job.</p>

        <p>This activity introduced me to IT certifications and the different advantages to having them. There are also many
            different sources to get your certification from however it’s important to research which one is most relevant to you. I
            learned that certifications help you stand apart from competing candidates and increase your career options while also
            sometimes increasing your pay. I learned that it is very much worth researching to see if certifications will help
            progress my career. After looking through the lists of certifications in the activity I found the one that interested me
            the most was Google’s project management certificate.

        <p>This activity was about the importance of having a good resume and using Linkedin. I learned the importance of a resume
            is it tells the employer what I want them to know about me and why I would be a good fit for the open position all in an
            easy to read, logical format. I should be customizing my resume for the specific position I'm applying for because it
            will help differentiate me from other applicants. I should be using keywords and phrases that fit the job because it
            will show I have the skills and knowledge for the position. I also learned how Linkedin is a tool that businesses use to
            screen and recruit potential employees. Something I will be doing in the future is read the job description carefully
            for whatever i’m applying for then customize my resume for that specific position, that way I will get the best chance
            of having an interview.
