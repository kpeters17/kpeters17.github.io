    <h1>Assignment 5</h1>

    <p>This activity was about what social networking is and the most popular platforms. Social networking is grouping
        individuals and organizations together to share thoughts, interests and activities. There are however several uses for
        social media such as online marketing, news and chatting. After looking over the list of most popular social networking
        sites I will definitely be paying more attention to Google+. I never really paid any attention to it and never
        considered it to be social media, however after seeing it’s popularity I want to learn more about it. My primary
        interest with these sites is for online marketing because I have little interest in chatting.</p>

        <p>This activity was about internet services and the components that create it. I learned that there are 4 main components;
            communication services, information retrieval service, web services and world wide web. Communication services allow the
            exchange of information between individuals or groups. Information retrieval services allow easy access to information
            from the internet. Web services allow the exchange of information between applications on the web. World wide web allows
            you to access documents that are spread over several severs on the internet. The thing from this activity that I will
            use going forward is remembering the different types of video conferencing. I must remember to be using a conference
            software that has a multi multipoint control unit so I can be able to connect to more than 1 location.

        <p>This activity was using Chrome remote desktop. I learned how the feature was originally a chrome extension but now is an
            easy to use web portal. It allows a permanent pre authorized connection to another computer that doesn’t require
            constant reverification. This is something I will use any time in the future when I want to access another computer
            that’s in a different physical location or if I’m trying to help someone who isn’t tech savvy with something on their
            computer. I’m sure there’s also many other situations that I haven’t encountered yet that using Chrome remote desktop
            will be very useful for.</p>
