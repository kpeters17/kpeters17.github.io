    <h1>Assignment 8</h1>

    <p>In this activity, I was introduced to many concepts and tips for internet safety. I learned not to have a false sense of
        security and treat it like any other public space. It’s important to create strong passwords in every online account to
        prevent hacking attempts. A password should be atleast 6 characters long, never have personal information, numbers,
        symbols, and both upper and lower case. It also shouldn’t be a word found in the dictionary. Having programs such as
        Bitdefender or Norton are important because they block malware from infecting my computer. Avoiding suspicious sites
        will put myself in a position where I won’t even have malware to deal with in the first place. In the future I will
        always make sure I have a hard to guess password, and will use a randomly generated one for maximum protection. By
        having antivirus programs installed before I connect to the internet I will make sure I am protected whenever i’m using
        a computer.</p>

        <p>This activity was ways I can use web browser options to have greater safety online. I learned about the various privacy
            options built into my browser such as “Do not track” requests and setting up data breach alerts. I learned how using
            incognito mode can help protect my identity online. I will always ensure my browser is kept up to date because this will
            protect me from malware. Whenever I am paying for something online I will pay attention to the security certificate to
            make sure it’s a secure connection. I will also use incognito mode if i’m ever using a public computer or a machine I
            don’t use often.
        </p>

        <p>This activity was about the comparison of different antivirus software and some of the different ways that they work. I
            learned how on demand scanning is what you usually think of when using antivirus software but there’s also on access
            scans which protect in real time. There are different kinds of threats that some antivirus programs don’t defend against
            so sometimes it’s best to use multiple programs.In the future I will use antivirus software that includes web protection
            because that helps against some of the most common forms of malware but I also want antispam and email security. Avast
            and AVG are both good choices that include many features that protect against online threats.</p>
