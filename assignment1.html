	The first topic was about what the internet actually is, clouds, and the basics of browsing the web.  I learned that web apps actually use clouds to run rather than your computer’s hard drive.  In the future I will most definitely be looking into using web apps whenever possible because not only does it save hard drive space but it makes it more convenient to share. By using clouds to host files it saves me time from having to attach files individually to emails.

	This lesson was all about how different applications use different files and how each file has it’s own file extension that changes depending upon what the file is used for. I also learned a significant number of keyboard and mouse shortcuts that can be used for various tasks. The keyboard shortcuts are a huge time saver that I will most definitely use in the future. I had no idea you could use ctrl + left/right arrow in order skip words. This is a huge time saver because I no longer have to lift my hand to use my mouse when I’m writing, in fact I used that shortcut just now! Pressing down the scroll wheel to open tabs without having to switch back and forth is another one that saves me a ton of time so I will also be using it a lot in the future.

	This lesson was about organizing folders,  copying documents to a USB drive and how to save documents.. I learned the proper procedures in transferring files to a USB and creating folders/subfolders in order to keep my files organized. In the future I will always create subfolders in my main folders because staying organized on the computer is an easy way to increase your productivity and make the experience of finding specific files less frustrating. I also never knew how important it was to right click your USB drive when you’re done and select “eject”. I will make sure I always do that since I do not want to lose any data.
