    <h1>Assignment 7</h1>

    <p>This activity was about the Internet domain name system and the components of TCP. I learned that TCP is the backbone of
        internet connections and allows a reliable flow of data. IP’s are paired with TCP in order to create the connection. UDP
        on the otherhand, is an unreliable protocol because it’s connectionless and doesn’t require a connection with the host.
        IP addresses are unique addresses for a machine over the internet and domain names are symbolic strings associated with
        a particular IP address. In the future, I will remember what computers have a particular IP address in my network so I
        can be able to diagnose problems easier. If I have a machine that needs a high flow of data I will make sure it’s a TCP
        connection rather than a UDP.</p>

        <p>This activity was about changing network adapter settings and TCP/IP settings. I learned what to do if i’m having
            problems connecting to the internet and using Microsoft’s network troubleshooter. Ipconfig is a command that can be used
            to display more information about IP settings and can be used to diagnose problems. In the ip settings I can configure
            subnet prefix length, gateway, DNS settings and DHCP manual or automatic. In the future I will be sure to use iponcfig
            to display more information if i’m having connectivity issues and I will use the network troubleshooter before I look at
            the network adapter settings.

        <p>This activity was about verifying internet connectivity and the various ways to troubleshoot connectivity issues. I
            learned how to ping myself and my local gateway in order to verify connectivity. There are numerous different ways to
            ping other machines such as using an IP address or internet host name. I will be using this as a more direct way to
            troubleshoot instead of relying on the Windows troubleshooter. By using the ping command I can manually check for
            connectivity on other machines in a network.</p>
