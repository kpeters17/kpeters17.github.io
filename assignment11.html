    <h1>Assignment 5</h1>

    <p>This lesson was quite interesting and about using multimedia in a webpage. I learned about using image editing software to create Raster and Vector then adding them to a website. I also learned how to add video to my web pages with HTML tags. Raster images use a rectangular grid of pixels while vector images use polygons and curves to produce an image. In the future, I will make sure I am using Vector images because not everyone views websites at the same resolution and if I use vector images there wonâ€™t be a chance that it looks pixelated. Adding video elements will also be a useful tool especially when creating websites to advertise a product.</p>
