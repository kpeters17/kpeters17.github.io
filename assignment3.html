    <h1>Assignment 3</h1>

    <p>The first activity was about using search engines and how they actually work. I learned about the different types of
        sites (commercial, organization, news, school, database, ect) and different techniques to get better search results. By
        adding a hyphen at the beginning of a word I can exclude certain words and by using quotation marks I can search for
        specific words. By reading the top-level domain I can also judge the credibility of the website, for example, a .gov or
        .edu will typically be more reliable than a .com website. All search engines can be broken down into 3 basic components,
        web crawler, database, and search interfaces. I will be using the hyphen and quotation marks a lot in the future to
        refine my search results. By keeping my searches as simple as possible and using critical thinking skills in order to
        choose the right wording I will get better search results overall.

        <p>I compared Google, Bing, Ask, and Yahoo to see which one was the better search engine. I searched for “Best IT careers”
            in each engine and it was very interesting to see the differences. Google was by far the most useful, it had 88 billion
            results with the most results per page. The interface was superior because it kept loading additional pages as I would
            scroll down. The results themselves were also better because the websites were from a greater variety and had many
            independent sources. Bing and Yahoo were the worst, the results were mostly only from big corporations and had numerous
            spam articles that I had to scroll past. Ask was about in the middle, it didn’t have as many results as Google but it
            had a good variety of different websites with no spam articles. In the future I will continue to use Google because I
            get the best results with it, I think this is the reason it has 86.71% of the market share. If I ever can’t find
            something on Google I will also give Ask a try.

        <p>I used Wikiversity’s cite this page to create citations and compared the different formats. Every format had similar
            information, however, “BibTex entry” was completely different because it was the only one written with code. The main
            difference was the location of “Date retrieved” and “Date of last revision”. I have used numerous citation creators in
            the past however this is the one I will now use in the future. All the others had you select the format before it
            generated the citation, I thought it was a nice feature to see all the formats on the same page. I also liked the simple
            clean interface that was just 1 entry box with a single button.</p>
