    <h1>Assignment 12</h1>

    <p>This lesson was about incorporating accessibility into websites. I learned about how important it is to have
        accessibility so everyone can be included. It is very unfair for someone to be unable to access content on a
        website because they have a visual, audio or cognitive impairment. I learned how to use the WAVE report to
        analyze a web page and gain insight into things I can do to make my sites more accessible to them. This was an
        invaluable lesson and something I will make part of my standard procedure in creating web pages for a product or
        service. By making sure everyone has an opportunity to access content I will increase web traffic to my pages
        and make sure no one feels excluded. I will make sure anyone who is disabled will have full access to every
        suggestion that the WAVE report makes.
