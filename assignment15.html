        This activity was extremely useful and interesting because it directly relates to my career choice. It was about
        project management and the various techniques to help you stay on task, and accomplish goals, all while also
        showing the progress to your team along the way. A project is classified as something temporary designed to
        produce a unique product with a defined beginning and end. The primary phases of most projects are initiating,
        planning, executing, monitoring & controlling and closing. In the future, I will take the time in the beginning
        of a project to properly plan the whole thing in its entirety. I will make sure to properly break down scope,
        time, and the budget while making everything very easy to understand by using a Gantt chart. I will also make
        sure to avoid common pitfalls such as scope creep as itâ€™s better to create a new project than continually expand
        the current one.. By having a strong plan in an easy to read format that the entire team can understand and read
        on their own time, I will be able to lead projects with success.
