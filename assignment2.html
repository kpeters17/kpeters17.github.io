    <h1>Assignment 2</h1>

    <p>The first activity was about what a web browser actually is and other various tips on using them. The basic components
        that all web browsers must possess are controllers, interpreters and client programs. URL's are used to access web pages
        and hyperlinks are used to take you to specific URL’s easily. Whole web pages or individual elements can also be saved
        onto your computer. I learned about installing browser plugins, customizing my browser and clearing my browser’s cache.
        The tip that I think I will use most in the future is using a URL shortener like tiny URL. I remember several instances
        where sometimes websites have ungodly long URL’s and if I had used a URL shortener it would have been much easier to
        share.

        <p>The second activity was about getting setup with google chrome for the first time. Downloading Chrome is simply done
            through Google's website, and all the steps required to install will be displayed on the screen in a popup. I learned
            how to create a shortcut for easy access and make Chrome my default browser. One of the most powerful features is the
            ability to sign in, giving me the ability to access things like history, settings, bookmarks, and passwords from any
            computer. The thing I will remember most in the future is to make sure I never sign into Chrome on a public computer
            because even though I may sign out of my Google account there’s still a chance I may still be signed into Chrome which
            would put my personal information at risk.
        </p>

        <p>The third activity was about configuring Chrome in order to get the most out of it. I learned about creating
            personalized profiles, filling out forms automatically, managing passwords, saving credit card information and keeping
            track of my browser history. I learned how to check if a website is secure and the specific kind of warning messages
            Chrome will give me depending upon the type of threat. There are several cool features that I will keep in mind for the
            future, and one I'm most excited to try is casting a Chrome tab onto my TV. I will also be sure to use incognito mode
            when using Chrome on a public network in order to protect my privacy. I’ll also make sure to keep unused tabs closed to
            keep Chrome running faster.</p>
