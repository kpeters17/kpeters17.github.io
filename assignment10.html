    <h1>Assignment 10</h1>

    <p>In this activity, I was introduced to many concepts and tips for internet safety. I learned not to have a false sense of
        security and treat it like any other public space. It’s important to create strong passwords in every online account to
        prevent hacking attempts. A password should be atleast 6 characters long, never have personal information, numbers,
        symbols, and both upper and lower case. It also shouldn’t be a word found in the dictionary. Having programs such as
        Bitdefender or Norton are important because they block malware from infecting my computer. Avoiding suspicious sites
        will put myself in a position where I won’t even have malware to deal with in the first place. In the future I will
        always make sure I have a hard to guess password, and will use a randomly generated one for maximum protection. By
        having antivirus programs installed before I connect to the internet I will make sure I am protected whenever i’m using
        a computer.</p>
