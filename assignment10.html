    <h1>Assignment 10</h1>

    <p>This activity was about Cascading Style Sheets, otherwise known as CSS. CSS is used to transform a dull boring
        looking website into something more aesthetically pleasing. It adds tons of formatting options including font
        size, color, background size, margins and so much more. CSS uses what are called rules instead of tag, each rule
        has a property and a value. The code for it can either be included in the HTML for each individual page, which
        is known as a inline style sheet. Or the code can be in an external .css file which is known as an external
        style sheet. I will be using this knowledge with what I learned in HTML to create better websites. I will play
        around with the different variables to tweak my web pages to not only look better but also function better. </p>
