    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;
    SELECT * FROM Customers,Suppliers;
    INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country) VALUES ('Kirk', 'Chicago', 'USA');
    UPDATE Customers SET ContactName = 'Bob', City= 'Denver' WHERE CustomerID = 2;
    DELETE FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'Canada';

        This activity was about structured query language and how to use it to retrieve data from tables. SQL is used
        for storing, manipulating and reading data from databases. I learned how to create SQL commands to not only
        select fields to display but also delete, edit or insert more data. This is something that I can use in multiple
        ways in the future. SQL can be used to create an inventory database that I can easily sort by whichever field I
        want or it can even be used for human resources to create a list of all employees with all their personal
        information. SQL can be a very powerful tool in order to stay organized and make a large amount of information
        more accessible which will then help me stay more organized.
